The first user experience thing you wanna focus on, is page loading times.
In fact, they've actually announced publicly that they use this as a ranking factor.
the other thing you wanna focus on when it comes to user experience, is whether your
website works well on a mobile device.
It's called the "mobile-friendly test."

### Security
SSL certificate makes it so that your website provides people with a secure "https"
connection.

### Optimising Content
First, if you're writing a thorough piece of content on a given topic, you might just end up
doing this naturally.
Of course, if this doesn't happen naturally, you might wanna intervene and adjust your text a
little here so that your keyword(s) appears in your article.
If you go over the top, Google might think that you're doing some "keyword stuffing."
Okay, so with all that said, how do you make sure you optimize your content, so that it
includes your main keyword/related keywords, without annoying Google?
You might just wanna make sure you include your target keywordâ€¦
Once in the intro
A few times throughout the body of your text
At least once in a H2 header
At least once in the conclusion
